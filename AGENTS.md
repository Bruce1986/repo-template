# Guidelines for Working with AI Assistant Feedback

This repository uses **gemini-code-assist** to provide review suggestions. The assistant may also help in verifying adherence to our unit testing standards for new functions.
Please address all suggestions from the AI assistant. If a suggestion is not implemented, provide a brief justification in the pull request discussion (e.g., as a comment on the pull request itself, or a comment directly on the line of code in question).

All new functions must include corresponding unit tests. If unit testing is not feasible for a particular function, a clear explanation should be provided (e.g., as a comment on the pull request itself, or a comment directly on the line of code in question).
